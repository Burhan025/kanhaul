In this project, I have enabled post thumbnails, added custom post types (slider, testimonial), created custom excerpts, and implemented custom page headers. I have managed sidebar creation, customized the WordPress dashboard, removed unwanted widgets, optimized the admin interface, and developed a schema-rich footer for SEO and usability.
